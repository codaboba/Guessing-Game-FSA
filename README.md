#Guessing Game
A Fullstack Academy Project

##Rules of the Game:

- Type a number between 1 - 100 into the input field and click "Go!" or `enter`

- The program will tell you you need to guess higher or lower

- You have 5 chances to guess the right number, otherwise you lose

- You may request a hint only once during the game, which gives you 3 different numbers (one of which will be the winning number)
